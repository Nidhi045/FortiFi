# Decentralized AI-Powered Financial Fraud Detection Framework

This repository contains the full-stack implementation of an advanced, privacy-compliant fraud prevention system designed for banks, fintech platforms, and digital payment infrastructures. It integrates decentralized identity, federated AI, privacy-first fraud detection, and secure transaction processing to counter modern financial threats.

## 📌 Overview

The system is designed to detect and prevent financial fraud in real-time using AI, blockchain, and graph analytics—without compromising user privacy. It includes proactive defense modules like phantom transactions, zero-knowledge identity vaults, tokenized data privacy layers, and real-time fraud scoring, ensuring both security and regulatory compliance.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Fraudulent transactions, synthetic identity fraud, and stolen credentials have risen dramatically in recent years. Traditional systems are slow, reactive, and siloed. There is a need for a real-time, interoperable, and privacy-compliant ecosystem to outsmart evolving fraud vectors.

## ✅ Proposed Solution

Our solution decentralizes fraud prevention using AI decoys, federated learning, encrypted tokenization, and on-chain identity tracking. It allows institutions to collaborate without exposing sensitive data, proactively identify fraudulent behavior, and comply with national data privacy laws.

## 🧠 Key Features

- **ShadowFi Protocol**: AI-powered decoy transactions and synthetic behavior modeling to confuse fraudsters.
- **SynapseSync**: Federated AI engine to propagate emerging fraud patterns across institutions securely.
- **Transaction Time-Lock**: Temporarily delays high-risk transactions to validate against behavioral history.
- **SplitMesh Tokenization**: Breaks sensitive data into encrypted shards to ensure regulatory compliance.
- **Real-Time Fraud Scoring**: Instant evaluation of fraud risk using live AI models.
- **Web3 Identity Vault**: Blockchain-based decentralized identity with breach tracking and privacy compliance.
- **Transaction Shadowing**: Creates AI-decoy transactions that mimic legitimate behavior for stealth detection.
- **Phantom Password**: Fake password exposure trap to detect fraud attempts during credential reuse.
- **Virtual Card Engine**: Issue disposable cards for high-risk or temporary transactions.

## 🔐 Compliance & Data Privacy

The solution is built in accordance with:

- **Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (India)**  
  > Ensures personal data is processed lawfully and minimally, with full transparency and user rights preserved.

- **IT Rules 2011 (SPDI Rules)**  
  > Adheres to India’s cybersecurity rules for collecting, processing, and storing sensitive personal data.

## 📊 Data Points Collected (Non-PII & Privacy-Compliant)

- Transactional behavior metadata (timing, device type, frequency)
- Decentralized breach flags (on-chain hash match only)
- Risk scores (anonymous, session-level)
- Network topology metadata (non-identifiable transaction graph)

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python, Solidity, TypeScript
- **AI/ML**: Federated learning, anomaly detection, time-series modeling
- **Blockchain**: Credential tracking, decentralized identity, audit trails
- **Databases**: Neo4j (graph), PostgreSQL (transactional)
- **Security**: Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Encrypted Tokenization, Secure Hashing
